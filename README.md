# Camera-Organizer

Camera-Organizer is a tool to help organize and rename folders generated by cameras, especially those with names in the NNNYMMDD format (e.g., 10050517). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to scan and rename these folders to a more readable convention: `YYYY-MM-DD[_CameraModel]`.

## How It Works

- **Folder Selection:**
  - Use the GUI to select a parent folder containing camera-generated folders.
- **Folder Scanning:**
  - The tool scans the selected folder (not subfolders) for directories matching the NNNYMMDD pattern.
- **Metadata Extraction:**
  - For each matching folder, it looks for files inside and tries to extract the creation date and camera model from the file metadata.
  - It checks several files in the folder to maximize the chance of finding valid metadata.
- **Sanity Check:**
  - The tool compares the date in the folder name to the extracted date from the file metadata and warns if they do not match.
- **Renaming:**
  - If valid metadata is found, the folder is renamed to `YYYY-MM-DD[_CameraModel]`.
  - If the camera model is unknown, it is omitted from the new name.
  - Folders are not renamed if the destination already exists or if there is not enough metadata.

## Platform Support

- This tool is designed for **macOS** and works best with a Python installation that has full `tkinter` support.
- **Note:** The system Python on macOS may have limited `tkinter` support, which can affect the appearance or functionality of the GUI. For best results, use a Python installation from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or a package manager like Homebrew.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (see `pyproject.toml` or use Poetry).
2. Run the GUI:
   ```bash
   python -m src.camera_organizer.main
   ```
3. Select the parent folder containing your camera folders.
4. Click "Rename Camera Folders" to process and rename them.
